I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geosciences at Princeton University (expected graduation May 2026), where I study how the ocean responds to a changing climate focusing on the cycling of oxygen and carbon. My research focuses on wind–wave–bubble processes at the air–sea interface and how they shape gas exchange, variability in the carbon sink, and oxygen distributions across the global ocean interior. I combine global ocean circulation models with observations from autonomous platforms and ship-based datasets to understand how small-scale surface processes translate into large-scale climate signals.

Before coming to Princeton, I earned a Master’s in Integrated Climate System Sciences at the University of Hamburg, Germany, where I focused on coupled ocean–atmosphere dynamics and carbon fluxes, and a Bachelor’s in Environmental Engineering in New Delhi, India, where I grew up.

Beyond research, I enjoy reading and writing, and am motivated by questions that connect fundamental ocean physics to policy-relevant climate challenges, such as new marine carbon dioxide removal research.
